At the beginning of each game, bonus health will be granted ranging from 0 - 10 (random, so some players might start off with more health).\nEach turn the warriors will be granted bonus damage ranging from 0 - 9 (also random). The game ends when one warrior has 0 health remaining". It works with two classes (Warriors class and Battle class).
